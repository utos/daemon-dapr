## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- A promise branch now inherits the run's ambient `env`, so `{{ env.x }}` resolves inside the
  workflow a branch runs just as it does inside an awaited sub-workflow. Previously each branch's
  execution context was built without the parent's env, so any activity in a branch that
  referenced `env` failed with an undefined-variable error mid-run. Env used in a branch's own
  input mapping was unaffected — the parent renders that before the branch starts — so this only
  showed up once a branch's own activities reached for it.

### Added

- `ObservabilityService.WatchExecution` now emits a structured terminal frame just before the
  stream closes: a final `WatchExecutionResponse` with `status` set to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`,
  and — on failure — an `error` (`WorkflowError` with code `EXECUTION_FAILED` and the failure
  reason as its message). Previously these fields were never populated and a watching client could
  only infer failure by scraping error-level log text before the stream closed. The terminal frame
  respects the request's level/source/category filters like any other frame (a `COMPLETED` frame is
  Info-level, source `system`), so an unfiltered watcher always receives it.
- `ExecutionService.ListExecutions` now honors the `ListExecutionsRequest.workflow` filter. When set,
  `name` selects the workflow (required — an empty name returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) and each further
  populated field of the `WorkflowReference` narrows the results: an omitted `version` matches all
  loaded versions, and `namespace`, `registry`, and `digest` match exactly when provided. To support
  digest/namespace/registry filtering, an execution now persists its full resolved workflow identity
  (the bundle content `digest` is captured on the creation event; namespace and registry are projected
  from the entry-point metadata), and execution summaries/details echo these fields back. Executions
  created before this change have no stored digest/namespace/registry and are not matched by a filter
  that specifies one of those fields. Previously the request was ignored and every execution returned.
- `ExecutionService.DeleteExecution` now deletes a terminal execution's record — both its read-model
  row and its `workflowexecution-{id}` / `subworkflowcalls-{id}` event streams (soft delete), so a
  projection rebuild cannot resurrect it. Deletion cascades to the execution's non-detached
  sub-workflow records; detached sub-workflows are independent top-level executions and are left
  untouched, continuing to run. A `SCHEDULED` or `ACTIVE` execution returns `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
  (it must be cancelled first) and an unknown id returns `NOT_FOUND`. Previously the RPC was
  unimplemented and returned `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
- Detached (fire-and-forget) sub-workflows via `WorkflowActivityConfig.detached`. When set, the
  executor starts the sub-workflow as its own independent, top-level execution instead of awaiting
  it as a Dapr child: the parent transitions immediately with a `{ "execution_id": "<id>" }` handle
  as the activity output, and the detached run gets its own execution id, log stream, and lifecycle,
  appears in `ListExecutions`, and may outlive the parent.
